## üíª Project

Nutricell is a project created to facilitate people's access to healthy eating tips, the idea is to create a dynamic and safe platform for everyone who wants to have a better life quality without radically changing their routine.

‚ùó **Important Disclaimer:** The interface in the prints below are all in Brazilian Portugese, the first language Nutricell was developed, but since 22/05/2020 it already supports English language (by default).

‚ùî **Portuguese Speaker?** If you want to. There's a full version of this document available in Brazilian Portuguese, which you can find [here](https://github.com/joojscript/Nutricell/blob/master/README-pt-br.md).

## ‚öô Platform

The platform is divided into two parts:

- **Web Platform** for the administration of the food and the users on the platform. Intended for system administrators and nutrition professionals.

- **Mobile App** for the general public.


## üñ• Web Platform

On the web platform is possible to create and edit foods, as well as to consult them repeatedly in list mode. Thus, the best visualization and administration is possible.
Only users registered as administrators in the system are able to have their login authorized.

 ## üì± Mobile App

Aimed at the general public, the application allows you to register as a user, giving your name, weight, age, height, email and password. And in addition to all this data it is also possible to inform if you have any type of disease that restricts the user from consuming any type of food (like diabetes, hypertension or lactose intolerance). So the system will be smart enough to shield these foods.
